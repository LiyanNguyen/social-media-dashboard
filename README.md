### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport first, then the Mobile viewport
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct

- Add the animations on button theme switcher
- Add JS function to change the base colors on the root to switch theme colors

### Built with
